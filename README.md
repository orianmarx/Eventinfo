<br><b>When:</b> November 7 - 8, 2014
<br><b>Time:</b> 6pm Friday – 9pm Saturday
<br><b>Location:</b> Hall of the Universe, American Museum of Natural History
<br><b>Theme:</b> Astrophysics and the Digital Universe

<b>What:</b> AMNH is hosting its first-ever hackathon along with an afternoon of lightning talks and hands-on activities focused on the intersection of computer science and astrophysics. Dubbed “Hack the Universe,” this is the launch event of BridgeUp: STEM, a new educational program focused on computer science for science and funded by a generous grant from the Helen Gurley Brown Trust.  The event will invite the public to build applications for the Digital Universe data set starting Friday evening and working overnight. Demos will be part of a cocktail reception at the conclusion of the event on Saturday evening. Saturday afternoon will also feature lighting talks and hands-on activities for youth to introduce them to the applications of computer science and data visualization in the study of the stars.
 
<b>BridgeUp: STEM </b>is a new initiative focused on computer science in science at AMNH. Funded by a generous grant from the Helen Gurley Brown Trust, BridgeUp: STEM will launch a portfolio of programs spanning after-school education, public programming, post-bacc fellowships, and teacher professional development. Hack the Universe is the first event for BridgeUp: STEM, showcasing the crucial role computer science plays in understanding our universe. <br><br>In January, we’ll launch our <b>Brown Scholars</b> program, a 2-year after-school intensive for 9th and 10th grade girls. In 2015 we’ll also welcome our first class of <b>Helen Fellows</b>, post-bacc research and teaching fellowships for women with computer science and computational science degrees, and kick off our <b>middle-school coding club.</b> BridgeUp: STEM is dedicated to increasing the diversity of the computer science talent pipeline and giving underrepresented students access to the skills and tools required for the 21st Century.
